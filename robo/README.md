# HQ-Announcements

Provides any Discord server the ability to set announcement channels and grant temporary access to team members to send messages and ping @everyone after entering in 2FA verification code.

## Why is this Open Source?

With how many compromises there are for NFT Discord servers, giving the option for auditors or projects to self host this bot is vital for increased protection in the space.

## Are you charging anything to use this?

No, it's open sourced! If you want to contribute to this project, I accept donations to 0xfA20a23efB1134E2abCde869Df79a1f0e8002376

## Upcoming Features

Saving wiped permissions during a lockdown and allowing them to be restored later. For now, I recommend using this with Wick and using a Wick backup if a lockdown triggers.

Slight fixes to global channel/guild perm checking.

## Setup Tips

Requires all intents when setting up the bot token
